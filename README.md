# [Secure Programming](http://carlosmccosta.github.io/Secure-Programming/)


## Overview
  In a globalized world where critical systems are controlled by computer software, it is imperative that their implementation is robust enough to endure possible attacks that can compromise the system confidentiality, integrity or availability and may put people’s lives at risk.
  
  As such, given the critical role that such systems have in our society, and the adverse effects that an attack could unleash, every critical system should adhere to several programming best practices, and be certified by independent authorities in order to achieve a stable and secure implementation.
  
  Although computer security is absolutely fundamental in a critical system, every computer software developer should also take into consideration some of the security best practices in order to make sure their software isn’t misused.
  
  As such, this project’s main objective is to raise awareness to programmers of the value of well written software implementations, and why they should invest their time in building secure systems.
  
  To achieve that, we will start by presenting the main vulnerabilities that can be exploited in an insecure implementation and what kind of programming and design flaws made then possible.
  
  Then, we will present the most important software techniques and methodologies that can be used to improve the security of a system and what kind of tools could help in the implementation and testing of these secure systems.
